## Citing astrobase

[Released verisons](https://github.com/waqasbhatti/astrobase/releases) of
**astrobase** are archived at [the Zenodo
repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1011188). Zenodo provides a DOI that
can be cited for each specific version. The following `bibtex` entry for
astrobase v0.3.8 may be useful as a template. You can substitute in values of
`month`, `year`, `version`, `doi`, and `url` for the version of `astrobase` you
used for your publication.

```tex
@misc{wbhatti_astrobase,
  author       = {Waqas Bhatti and
                  Luke G. Bouma and
                  Joshua Wallace},
  title        = {\texttt{astrobase}},
  month        = feb,
  year         = 2018,
  version      = {0.3.8},
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.1185231},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1185231}
}
```

Alternatively, the following `bibtex` entry can be used for all versions of
**astrobase**:

```tex
@misc{wbhatti_astrobase,
  author       = {Waqas Bhatti and
                  Luke G. Bouma and
                  Joshua Wallace},
  title        = {\texttt{astrobase}},
  month        = oct,
  year         = 2017,
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.1011188},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1011188}
}
```
