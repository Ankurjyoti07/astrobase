## Citing astrobase

`astrobase` versions are archived at Zenodo:
https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/75150575. This provides a DOI that can be
cited for each specific version. You can substitute in values of `month`,
`year`, `version`, `doi`, and `url` for the version of `astrobase` you used.
The following `bibtex` entry may be useful as a template.

```tex
@misc{wbhatti_astrobase,
  author       = {Waqas Bhatti and
                  Luke G. Bouma and
                  Joshua Wallace},
  title        = {\texttt{astrobase}},
  month        = feb,
  year         = 2018,
  version      = {0.3.8},
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.1185231},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1185231}
}
```

Alternatively, the following `bibtex` entry can be used for all versions of
`astrobase`:

```tex
@misc{wbhatti_astrobase,
  author       = {Waqas Bhatti and
                  Luke G. Bouma and
                  Joshua Wallace},
  title        = {\texttt{astrobase}},
  month        = oct,
  year         = 2017,
  publisher    = {Zenodo},
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.1011188},
  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1011188}
}
```
